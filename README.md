<h2>Context</h2>
As a leading producer of chemicals, ChemCorp has been in continual operations and distribution center expansion due to 7% growth averaging strong market demand yearly. The favorable growth rates and lowered barriers to entry has attracted increased competition from new startups who are offering optimized delivery channels for chemicals and the use of new technologies to create new and existing chemicals at a lower production cost. There is the need to protect the future market share and growth of ChemCorpâ€™s industries.



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
In the next 6 months, we aim at a 10% increase in revenue.





<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>	Among ChemCorp's six main businesses, Paper and Packaging boasts the highest revenue, while Pharmaceutical ranks lowest in terms of revenue.</b>
- <b>ChemCorp offers eleven chemical products (A-K), with Chemical K leading in revenue, followed by Chemicals H and I. Conversely, Chemical A generates the least revenue among the products. </b>
- <b>Chemical E yields the highest profit across all business segments, with Chemicals C, G, J, K, H, F, D, I, and B following in descending order. Chemical A's profit is notably 55 times lower than that of 
     Chemical E.</b>
- <b>Chemicals D, E, B, and C witness higher percentages of customer purchases, whereas Chemicals A and K have lower percentages. Despite this, Chemical K generates approximately 37 times more profit than    
    Chemical A. Implementing new marketing strategies for Chemical K could potentially boost customer patronage. </b>
- <b>Although there is no consistent seasonal trend in product sales, Chemical H experiences a significant increase in May followed by a decline until another rise in November. Chemical K similarly sees a sharp 
     decline in April and rise in June.</b>
- <b>Geographically, California generates the highest revenue for ChemCorp, followed by New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas in the Eastern, Western, and Southern regions of the United States, respectively. North 
     Dakota, situated in the Northern zone, generates the least revenue.</b>
- <b>The North Central region boasts the highest revenue across all business segments, while New England ranks lowest. Given North Dakota's location within the North Central Region, it presents a promising 
     opportunity for investment to promote chemicals and enhance revenue.</b>
- <b>Biotechnology demonstrates the highest %Average Profit Margin overall, followed by Machinery and Industrial Goods. However, despite Paper and Packaging leading in revenue, it exhibits the lowest %Average 
     Profit Margin. Exploring cost reduction strategies could potentially elevate the segment's profit margin.</b>
- <b>Biotechnology, despite having fewer average total businesses compared to Machinery, achieves the highest %Average Profit Margin, followed by Machinery and Industrial Goods. Paper and Packaging, while 
      ranking third in Average total business, has the lowest %Average Profit margin. Aerospace Defense, with the least average total businesses and the second lowest %Average Profit Margin, appears less 
      favorable for investment.</b>
- <b>Machinery and Industrial Goods, along with Medical Equipment, emerge as the top two segments when considering total businesses, %Average profit margin, and revenues, whereas Aerospace Defense ranks lowest 
      among the segments.</b>
